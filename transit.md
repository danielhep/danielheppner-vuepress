# Why I care about transit
First of all, I think it's important to talk about why I care about public transit. I believe that global warming is a pressing issue, and the largest source of greenhouse gases for most people is from their cars. The more trips we can convert to non-car transport, the better. 

# What I've done to support transit 
- Founded a transit advocacy club at my university.
- Volunteered time for transit advocacy groups in Seattle and Bellingham.
- Build Headways transit schedule analysis software. (actually... this one is a WIP)
