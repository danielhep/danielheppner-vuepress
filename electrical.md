# Electrical Engineering Background
Electrical engineering is the name of my degree, and therefore it is the subject in which I have the most formal experience. However, my experience is not limited to what I've learned in the classroom. I chose double-E because I wanted to continue the experiences I had in high school robotics, where I worked on embedded systems and motor control design. 

My university gave me ample hands on experience. Almost every class had a lab component, and since class sizes were very small, we got lots of time with the professors to ask questions and get personal help.

### Door Machine
When I was a freshman living in the dorms, I worked on a project that I called the "door machine". This was basically just my experimentation ground to try various sensors and components that I found on eBay. In the end, it had a fairly random assortment of features:

- Capacitive touch sensor to create special effects when the metal rim of the peep hole was touched.
- LCD display to show our "away" status.
- LED strips for special effects
- RF Transmitter to toggle lights in the room
- Motion detector to light up hallway when people passed by.

Ultimately, the project got the attention of a CS professor at the school, who asked me to give a presentation on it at the PNW LinuxFest hosted in Bellingham. A recording of my speech is here:

## Departures - A Transit Display Board
My senior project turned into an ongoing project for me, since it is a great intersection of my interests. I am still working on this project. It is a LED departures board ala one you would see in a train station. I'm working on bringing this as a product to market.

This project has involved the use of my Headways project under Software Engineering, which is the data backbone that grabs schedule and real time information from transit systems to be displayed on the board.
